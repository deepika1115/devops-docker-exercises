# MANDATORY EXERCISE 1.14: ENVIRONMENT

## Description

Start both the frontend and the backend with the correct ports exposed and add ENV to Dockerfile with the necessary information from both READMEs (front, back).

Ignore the backend configurations until the frontend sends requests to _backend_url_/ping when you press the button.

You know that the configuration is ready when the button for 1.14 of frontend responds and turns green.

Do not alter the code of either project

Submit the edited Dockerfiles and commands used to run.

## Solution

The updated Dockerfile from example frontend and example backend are added in this folder named as Dockerfile-Frontend and Dockerfile-Backend resp.

The commands used to build run the containers for both backend and frontend are in the 'commands.txt'.

The screenshot for running app is also added in this exercise folder.
