# EXERCISE 1.9: VOLUMES

## Description
In this exercise we won't create a new Dockerfile.

Image devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service creates a timestamp every two seconds to /usr/src/app/text.log when it's not given a command. Start the container with a bind mount so that the logs are created into your filesystem.

Submit the command you used to complete the exercise.

# Solution

The screenshot of the command run in terminal to complete this exercise is added in the 'exercise1.9' folder.
