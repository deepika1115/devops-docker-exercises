# devops-docker-exercises

This repository contains solutions to Docker with DevOps exercises from the University of Helsinki.

I have completed 2 parts.

The exercise solution for each part are in the folder named as "exercise<exercise_number>" for eg. exercise1.1 and so on.

Each exercise contains a README where you can find the description of the exercise question and solution description.

The exercise may contain screenshot image of the commands or the txt files for the commands or Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml file, according to the question in the exercise.
